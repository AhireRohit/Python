# Relational Operators

# Relational operators are used to evaluate conditions inside if statements. Some examples of relational operators are:
# = = -> equals
# >=  -> greater than/equal to
# <=, etc.

# Logical Operators

# In python, logical operators operate on conditional statements. Example:
# and -> true if both operands are true else false
# or -> true if at least one operand is true else false
# not -> inverts true to false and false to true
