# Set is a collection of non repetitive elements
# If set has 2 same values it will print only once

# Properties of Sets

#     Sets are unordered # Elements order doesnâ€™t matter
#     Sets are unindexed # Cannot access elements by index
#     There is no way to change items in sets
#     Sets cannot contain duplicate values
